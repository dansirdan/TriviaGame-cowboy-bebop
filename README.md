Hard Assignment challenge

- A trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

- If the player selects the correct answer, it shows a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question without user input.

- The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

- Correct and Wrong gifs are randomly selected from an array of 4 different gifs. Makes the game feel deeper.

- If the player runs out of time, it displays that the player's time is up and displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

-If the player chooses the wrong answer, it displays to the player that they selected the wrong option and then displays the correct answer. Waits a few seconds, then shows the next question.

- On the final screen, it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
